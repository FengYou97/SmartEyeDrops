# Smart Eye Drops
**Android App Development for California State University - Los Angeles, Computer Science Senior Design Project.**
***Sponsored by Vodafone***

We plan to develop a completely new eye drop adherence monitor that will fit any bottle, accurately record when patients take medication, and have the ability to transfer data to physicians via a wireless network. Upon completion, our eye drop adherence monitor will help patients abide by their treatment plan with timely reminders, and it will allow physicians to see how well their patients are adhering to medication regimens and accurately determine if prescribed medications are acting effectively. This project has the potential to help reduce blindness caused by diseases such as glaucoma.
